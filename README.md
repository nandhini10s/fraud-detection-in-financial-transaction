Cleaned the data by treating the empty values.

Created a new feature “Elapsed Time” using the datetime data.

Treated multicollinearity issue by dropping a variable from the model.

Utilised one hot encoding technique to convert text to numeric value.

Standardised the data to boost the efficiency of the machine learning model.

Deployed ML models and chose the best model based on performance

Metrics used:
Accuracy score,  Precision, Recall and F1 score

Best  Model : Logistic Regression

Train Score : 81.46

Test Score : 84.8
